<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repository contains code produced as part of various adventurous assignments, projects and courses during my studies for a Bachelor's degree (B.Sc.) in computer Science at The University of Troms√∏ - The Arctic University (Uit). This repository is intended to serve as a reference for future projects, budding programmers, haters, employers and other curious people on how to (or how not to...) do various stuff in different languages.

Note that some code in this repository were provided as part of one or more assignments, or were made jointly with other students during collaborative projects.
